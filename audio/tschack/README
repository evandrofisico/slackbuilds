tschack is a fork of jack-audio-connection-kit, implementing
SMP support and clickless connection changes.

jackd has to run with realtime privileges.  One way to do this on Slackware
would be to use set_rlimits.  Since 12.2 there's another way - if you have
a filesystem that supports posix capabilities (reiserfs does not), you can
grant jackd the rights to run in realtime mode, even when started as a normal 
user, with the following command:

  setcap cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_nice=ep /usr/bin/jackd

If you use qjackctl to start jack, it will need the same capabilities set
to be able to start jack as non-root user.  You can use the same command
with 'qjackctl' instead of 'jackd'

Optional dependencies are libffado, and celt.

This conflicts with jack-audio-connection-kit.

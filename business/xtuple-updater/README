xtuple-updater is a qt application for updating the xtuple
database for a new release.

The required update-scripts can be obtained from the sourceforge
project page (http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/postbooks).
They are named for example pb331to340, which would contain
the files necessary to update from xtuple-3.3.1 to 3.4.0.

This requires libqsqlpsql, openrpt and xtuple.

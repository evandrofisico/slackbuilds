Fully integrated ERP, CRM, and accounting for small to midsized
businesses. Business logic resides in PostgreSQL database server.
Fully international-ready.

For xtuple to work correctly you need to setup postgresql.
Issuing the following commands should be enough:
  psql -U postgres -f /usr/share/xtuple/init.sql
  createdb -U admin NEW_DATABASE_NAME
  pg_restore -U admin -d NEW_DATABASE_NAME postbooks_quickstart.backup -v

The "postbooks_quickstart.backup" file is one of three database schemas
available. The others are "postbooks_demo.backup" and "postbooks_empty.backup".
You will have to choose one of these depending on your needs.

Alternatively you can use the supplied xtuple-setup.sh script to setup
xtuple. You then need to have the above mentioned db-backup files to be
in /usr/share/xtuple.

You can include them into the package by putting the *.backup file(s) you
want into the same directory as the SlackBuild before running it.

This requires libqsqlpsql, openrpt, cvsimp and postgresql (runtime dependency).
